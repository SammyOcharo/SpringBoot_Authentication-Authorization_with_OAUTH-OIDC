### Authentication with OpenID and Keycloak

This project uses OpenID Connect for authentication, integrated with Keycloak as the identity provider. OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which allows clients to verify the identity of the end user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end user. Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management solution that makes it easy to secure applications and services with little to no code. In this Spring Boot application, Keycloak handles the heavy lifting of authentication, user management, and authorization. The integration ensures secure and seamless user login and provides a robust foundation for managing user identities and access control in the application.
